# Stellar Wind
Unique music composed by a decentralized organism - the Stellar transaction network

## Description

Stellar Wind transforms the activity on the Stellar Network into harmonic musical art.
It is intended to be kept open in a browser tab to listen to for relaxation, coding or any other activity requiring calmness and focus.
Headphone usage strongly recommended!

## Data

The data for Stellar Wind to compose music comes from the Horizon API server. It captures all occurring transactions in a stream and stores all non zero amounts from operations.
Those amounts are taken of the array in regular intervals, normalized and used as inputs for the music composition.
